# An introduction to observing turbulence in the ocean

This module was developed by Isabelle Giddy for the University of Gothenburg Department of Marine Sciences Masters level course OC4920: Observing the ocean from macro to micro scale (Version 1, Copyright 2025). Iâ€™d like to acknowledge my own teachers in ocean turbulence, Prof Ilker Fer, Dr. Lars Arneborg and Dr. Daniel Whitt who have in some way informed the content of this module. I am gratefully hosted at the University of Gothenburg Marine Sciences Department and supported by the VR International Postdoctoral Grant and the Prof Sebastiaan Swarts Wallenberg Academy Fellowship, which make being an independent researcher possible.
