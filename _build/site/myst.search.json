Surface gravity waves are simply defined as orbital waves that decay exponentially with depth, but they are not perfectly orbital: moving slightly faster at the crest and slower at the troughs due to the return flow. This results in a small but not insignificant current confined to the wave impacted layer of the OSBL.

THe streaks were parallel to the wind direction and appeared to follow the ambient wind direction. Following this observation, Langmuir ran an experiment in a lake to test the hypothesis that these streaks were a result of overturning cells linked to wind and wave forcing. Today known as Langmuir cells. Langmuir cells form as a result of the interaction between the background vertical vorticity forced by winds and the Stokes drift current which converts vertical vorticity to the horizontal vorticity. It has become broadly accepted that wave driven Langmuir cells are ubiquitous in the ocean and play an important role in the turbulent flux of matter and momentum. The intensity of Langmuir turbulence is described by the turbulent Langmuir number, La_t = \\sqrt{\\frac{u_*}{U_s}}, where U_s is the Stokes drift.\n\n\n\nFigure 9:Langmuir circulation.

The oceanographic context and a detailed analysis of the data collected during this cruise are given in van der Lee and Umlauf (2011). The total depth was about 85 m. The instrument used was a MSS-Microstructure profiler with the serial number 38, produced by Sea & Sun Technology, Germany. It was equipped with two randomly oriented shear probes, one FP07 thermistor, and one PT100 temperature sensor and a conductivity cell for precision temperature and salinity measurements. The probe was also fitted with a vibration sensor, which is similar in design to a shear probe sensor, except that the airfoil is replaced by a small mass and is mounted inside the probe. The probe was connected with a cable to a ship-board data acquisition system and was operated with an electrical winch from the stern of the ship. During the profiling, the ship slowly moved along a transect with a speed of approximately 0.5 m s−1. The transect was oriented such that wind and surface currents came from the bow, such that the loosely tethered cable was always at a safe distance to the ship’s propeller. Using a sensor protection cage, it was possible to obtain nearly full-depth vertical profiles to within 0.1 m above the seafloor, with a descent speed of approximately 0.5 m s−1 .\n\nFirst we will take a look at a few metrics to get familiar with dissipation data\n\n# The data is stored as a grouped NetCDF file.\n# First look at the global attributes.\ndat_b=xr.open_dataset('assignment/baltic/MSS_Baltic.nc', engine=\"h5netcdf\",group=\"\")\ndat_b.attrs\n\n# open each group separately\n\ndat_bL1=xr.open_dataset('assignment/baltic/MSS_Baltic.nc', engine=\"h5netcdf\",group=\"L1_converted\")\ndat_bL2=xr.open_dataset('assignment/baltic/MSS_Baltic.nc', engine=\"h5netcdf\",group=\"L2_cleaned\")\ndat_bL3=xr.open_dataset('assignment/baltic/MSS_Baltic.nc', engine=\"h5netcdf\",group=\"L3_spectra\")\ndat_bL4=xr.open_dataset('assignment/baltic/MSS_Baltic.nc', engine=\"h5netcdf\",group=\"L4_dissipation\")\n\n","type":"content","url":"/obs-of-shear#baltic-sea-a-quiescent-region","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Assignment: The observation and interpretation of turbulence dissipation","lvl4":"Plot vertical profile of temperature","lvl3":"Baltic Sea - A quiescent region","lvl2":"Part I"},"type":"lvl4","url":"/obs-of-shear#plot-vertical-profile-of-temperature","position":6},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Assignment: The observation and interpretation of turbulence dissipation","lvl4":"Plot vertical profile of temperature","lvl3":"Baltic Sea - A quiescent region","lvl2":"Part I"},"content":"1.1 Describe what you can about the hydrographic structure from this plot.

Due to its random character and complexity a generally valid theory for turbulence is lacking and turbulence remains one of the major unsovled problems of classic physics. Nevertheless, turbulent flows can be described. Here, we will look at the description of turbulence in oceanic flows.\n\nTurbulence results from the nonlinear nature of advection, which enables interactions between motions on different spatial scales. Consequently, an initial disturbance with a given characteristic length scale tends to spread to progressively larger and smaller scales. This expansion is limited at large scales by boundaries and at small scales by viscosity.\n\nBy deforming a fluid, via stirring and strain, gradients are increased thus increasing the area available for molecular diffusion which occurs at small scales (the Kolmogorov length scale), effectively increasing the rate of mixing by several orders of magnitude (see Fig 2).

Small uncertainties in the initial and boundary conditions quickly amplify, rendering a deterministic description of individual turbulent fluctuations impossible. Turbulence can be described statistically (statistical moments, correlations, probability distributions).\n\nIncreased Transport and Mixing: Turbulent flows generally show strongly increased mixing and transport rates of matter, heat, and momentum because of the generation of sharp gradients and increased contact surfaces due to the complex strain field associated with the turbulent motions.\n\nVorticity: Turbulent flows are characterized by vorticity, manifested in the omnipresence of eddying motions. These vortices (“eddies”) involve a wide range of spatial wavelengths, ranging from the largest scales imposed by the bounding geometry down to the smallest scales, where eddies are dissipated due to molecular (viscous) smoothing.\n\nDissipative: Turbulence is “dissipative,” meaning the kinetic energy is dissipated into heat due to viscous friction at the smallest scales. Similarly, scalar fluctuations are smoothed by molecular diffusion, implying that the overall scalar variance is reduced. Thus, a mechanism must exist to transport energy and scalar variance from the largest scales, where they are introduced to the system, towards the smallest scales, where they are dissipated (broad energy spectrum).```{tableofcontents}\n``` ","type":"content","url":"/what-is-turbulence#defintion-of-turbulence","position":9}]}
