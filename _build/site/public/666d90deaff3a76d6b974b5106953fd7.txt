 'comment': "Ocean turbulence data were collected using a Slocum electric glider as platform. Glider was deployed and recovered during the 2019-2020 SANAE South African Antarctic base resupply cruise on the RV SA Agulhas II. The MR operated continously on both dives and climbs from the surface to a depth of 500 m. The data from the MR include measurements from 2 shear probes, 2-axis piezo-accelerometers (vibration), an inclinometer (pitch and roll) and a pressure transducer. The processing of the data and the format of this data set follows the recommendations and guidelines of the SCOR Working Group 160, ATOMIX (https://wiki.uib.no/atomix), and the processing was done using the standard Matlab tools provided by Rockland Scientific. One NetCDF file per instrument's native file (typically one file per cast) is provided. Each netCDF file includes 4 groups: 4 levels of microstructure data in ATOMIX format. L1_converted : full-resolution data converted to physical units L2_cleaned : selected signals that are filtered and/or despiked before spectral analysis. Time stamp and length of the signals are same as L1. L3_spectra : wavenumber spectra from shear probes and vibration sensors L4_dissipation: dissipation estimates together with quality control parameters Spectral calculation and dissipation rate estimate details are given in the attributes and processing parameters. Spectra are obtained using 2-s fft length. Dissipation estimates are obtained over 12s segments, overlapping by 6s (50% overlap). Detailed data processing parameters and choices can be found in the attributes. Shear and vibration spectra, their complex cross-spectra, and the cleaned shear spectra using the Goodman method are provided. L4 includes estimates from both shear probes, using the cleaned spectra, as well as their average, together with quality control parameters. The figure of merit (FOM) and mean absolute deviation (MAD) relative to the Nasmyth model spectrum are used. Data quality flags for dissipation estimates are summarized in the attributes of the variable EPSI_FLAGS in the L4 group. A final dissipation estimate, EPSI_FINAL, failing the data quality control is reported as NaN; however, the individual dissipation estimates from each probe are accessible in the EPSI parameter.",

 'title': 'Dissipation measurements from a Slocum Glider in the Southern Ocean during austral summer 2017, 2018 and 2019',
 'summary': 'This dataset includes data from 3 missions in the Southern Ocean between 2017 and 2020. This data file is for the mission in the Seasonal Ice Zone between 2019 and 2020. Ocean microstructure data were collected using a turbulence package mounted on a Slocum and deployed from RV SA Agulhas II in the North Eastern Weddell Sea, [60S; 0E], from December 2019 to February 2020. Observations conducted by the Southern Ocean Carbon-Climate Observatory, Smart Places, CSIR, for the project "Contemporary and Future Drivers of CO2 and Heat in the Southern Ocean" funded by NRF-SANAP (SANAP200324510487) and in collaboration with Polar Gliders, University of Gothenburg (Project "Robotic Observations and Modelling of the Marginal Ice Zone" funded by the Wallenberg Academy Fellowship (WAF 2015.0186). Turbulence data were collected using a Rockland Scientific MicroRider mounted on the SLOCUM. Microshear was measured using two airfoil shear probes oriented orthogonally to each other. The measurements are from 47 days of dive and climb profiles. The glider profiled to 1000 m, but the MicroRider only recorded to 500 m. Dissipation rate was measured using two airfoil shear probes. The dissipation dataset is processed and prepared following the SCOR Working Group ATOMIX guidelines and convention (Lueck et al., 2024). The glider data are processed using the GEOMAR Matlab Slocum glider processing toolbox (Krahmann, 2023). One NetCDF(NC) file per instrument\'s native file (typically one file per cast) is provided. Each provided NC file includes four hierarchical groups. Each consists of a continuous time series of full-resolution data converted into physical units; the cleaned time series used for spectral analysis, wavenumber spectra, and the dissipation rate estimates. Because each file includes full-resolution data at two levels and full-resolution spectra in the third group, the grouped NC files are large in size and may be unpractical to download and merge. For users only interested in the dissipation and the glider flight metrics and CTD profiles (in the hotel file), we also provide two separate NC files with all sections from the L4_dissipation and the hotel file collated into one file each. Further details are provided in the comments.'}
